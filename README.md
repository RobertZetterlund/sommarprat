# What is "sommarprat"

> Sommar i P1 is one of the biggest radio shows in Sweden and a staple in Swedish culture. Everyone knows the well-known signature and the show itself. It is on air every year during the summer, and has been ever since its start in 1959.
>
> The show is made up by interesting Swedish-speaking persons who get free hands to create their own hour and a half-long show. They get to choose their own music and what they want to talk about.
>
> Being a host on Sommar i P1 has been compared to receiving a knighthood in Sweden.
