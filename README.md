# What is "sommarprat"

> Sommar i P1 is one of the biggest radio shows in Sweden and a staple in Swedish culture. Everyone knows the well-known signature and the show itself. It is on air every year during the summer, and has been ever since its start in 1959.
>
> The show is made up by interesting Swedish-speaking persons who get free hands to create their own hour and a half-long show. They get to choose their own music and what they want to talk about.
>
> Being a host on Sommar i P1 has been compared to receiving a knighthood in Sweden.

# Why

I want to explore how representative the music tastes for the hosts of "Sommar i P1" is for the swedish population. Also I might be able to extend this [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/favorite-songs.html) piece about when music tastes form. Questions that interest are:

- How much does recency of release date affect the selection of ones playlist.
- Is the age of when you heard the song (i.e. it was released) important?
- Who has the most obscure music in "Sommar i P1"?
- Who has the saddest music in "Sommar i P1"?
- Which is the most played song by hosts in "Sommar i P1"?
- Etc.
